Benchmarks
==========

The `bench` directory in the Bril repository contains a fledgling suite of microbenchmarks that you can use to measure the impact of your optimizations.
(Benchmarks are different from tests because they are meant to actually calculate something instead of just exercising a language feature.)

The current benchmarks are:

* `check-primes`: Check the first *n* natural numbers for primality, printing out a 1 if the number is prime and a 0 if it's not.
* `fib`: Calculate the *n*th Fibonacci number by allocating and filling an [array](../lang/memory.md) of numbers up to that point.
* `fizz-buzz`: The infamous [programming test][fizzbuzz].
* `loopfact`: Compute *n!* imperatively using a loop.
* `orders`: Compute the order ord(u) for each u in a cyclic group [<Zn,+>][cgroup] of integers modulo *n* under the group operation + (modulo *n*). Set the second argument *is_lcm* to true if you would like to compute the orders using the lowest common multiple and otherwise the program will use the greatest common divisor.
* `quadratic`: The [quadratic formula][qf], including a hand-rolled implementation of square root.
* `recfact`: Compute *n!* using recursive function calls.
* `sieve`: Print all prime numbers up to *n* using the [Sieve of Eratosthenes][sievee].
* `collatz`: Print the [Collatz][collatz] sequence starting at *n*. Note: it is not known whether this will terminate for all *n*.
* `ackermann`: Print the value of `Ack(m, n)`, the [two-argument Ackermann-PÃ©ter function][ackermann].
* `sum-sq-diff`: Output the difference between the sum of the squares of the first *n* natural numbers and the square of their sum.
* `sqrt`: Implements the [Newton-Raphson Method][newton] of approximating the square root of a number to arbitrary precision
* `perfect`: Check if input argument is a perfect number.  Returns output as Unix style return code. 
* `mat-mul`: Multiplies two `nxn` matrices using the [naive][matmul] matrix multiplication algorithm. The matrices are randomly generated using a [linear congruential generator][rng].
* `gcd`: Calculate Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two input positive integer using [Euclidean algorithm][euclidean_into].
* 'euclid': Calculates the greatest common divisor between two large numbers using the [Euclidean Algorithm][euclid] with a helper function for the modulo operator.
